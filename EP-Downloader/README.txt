This program is made to make the process of downloading ROMs off the EmuParadise forums easier.

Currently, it simply reads through every link in the text file, and opens the download page.
If I can ever figure out how, it may automate the download as well, but there aren't any promises.

Instructions:
1. Copy the entire path to the text file containing the URLs.
	the program will then open every URL in the file
2. The user can npw download each of the files from its page.
